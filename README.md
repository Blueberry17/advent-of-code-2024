# advent-of-code-2024
Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in Python, written by Anthony Berry.

Each part for each day is stored in a separate file.
Solutions are uploaded in a very similar state to how they originally were, when first obtaining the correct answer.

# Running
To run the code for a specific day and part with this as the root directory, use the following format.
```
python3 src/day01/p1.py
```

# Lessons

5. Look out for ways to change the iterable without breaking the loop.
6. Always, always, always test end of line bugs.
7. Just begin with the better algorithm, rather than duplicating effort for part 2.
8. Use imaginary numbers instead of tuples.
9. Pointers can be integral.
10. Once recursion starts working, it's so good.
11. Functools.cache() for memoization!
12. Number of corners = number of sides for polygons.
13. Math is always the most efficient.
14. Complexity is king.
15. Rather than checking every case, try to break your program.
