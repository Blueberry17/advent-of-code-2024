Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in Python, written by Anthony Berry.

Each part for each day is stored in a separate file.

# Running
To run the code for a specific day and part with this as the root directory, use the following format.
```
python3 src/day01/p1.py
```

# Lessons
1. Maybe day 1 will stay relaxed after all!
2. It's still too soon to relive 2015 day 19...
3. Regexes can be so elegant at times.
4. When iterating over different lines in a grid, use vectors to make it general.
5. Look out for ways to change the iterable without breaking the loop.
6. Always, always, always test end of line bugs.
